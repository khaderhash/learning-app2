## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project was built using modern technologies and best practices to ensure high performance and scalability.

- **Frontend:**
  - **Framework:** Flutter 3.x
  - **State Management:** GetX (Reactive State Management)
  - **Architecture:** MVC (Model-View-Controller) with GetX
  - **Networking:** `http` package for RESTful API communication.
  - **Local Storage:** `flutter_secure_storage` for securely storing authentication tokens.
- **Backend (External):**
  - A robust **Laravel** backend provides the RESTful APIs for all data operations.

### Architectural Approach

The application follows a **feature-first** directory structure, where each feature (e.g., `auth`, `quiz`, `chat`) is a self-contained module. Within each module, the code is organized into:
- **`Models`**: Defines the data structures.
- **`Providers` (Data Layer)**: Handles raw data fetching from the API.
- **`Controllers` (Logic Layer)**: Manages the state and business logic for each screen.
- **`Views` (UI Layer)**: Renders the UI based on the controller's state.
- **`Bindings`**: Handles dependency injection for the controllers.

This approach ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the app easy to test, debug, and scale.
